        <h1>Why I Code</h1>
        <p>
         I started coding around December of last year, you see, i was stuck with an
         idea for an application that would allow indiependent creators
         of all kind, artist, actors, directors all the way down to 
         set designers and special effects guys (or girls).
         After talking with some developers on Upwork I was given an 
         estimation on how much it might cost for someone to build my application,
         it would be anywere between 200k and 300k. 
         I knew there was no way i'd be able to raise that kind of money,
         so after a few weeks of letting sit in the back of my mind
         i came to a solution, "if it cost so much for a developer to build my app, then ill just become
         a developer", after this i started on my journy of becoming a developer,
         I still have some ways to go regarding the application, but in mean time I hope
         that you'ed consider me for spot on your team.</p>
         
         <p>Thank you.</p>

        <p>
         I've been coding HTML5 and CSS3 consistantly for the past 
         five months, while i've been using design tools such as figma 
         and PhotoShop for much longer.
         i've recently started implamenting JavaScript into my code
         while maintaining steady growth with my markup and design skills.
